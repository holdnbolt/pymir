### **aka Playing around with 2D Game Engines: The Library**

__Not related to mir, the dead displayer manager__

Ymir is the creator "god" in Norse Mythology.  I wanted to just call the library Ymir but that isn't as sexy as adding the language name so naturally I stumbled upon Python Ymir = pYmir = pymir.

This is still under active development so I'm not even sure what the basic interface will look like a week from now.  If you wanna help though I'd be glad to take a PR.
